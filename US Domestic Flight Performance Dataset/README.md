# Visualising the US Domestic Flight Performance between 1987 to 2020

This project primarily focuses on analysing the average yearly performance and delays of flights that took place between 1987 and 2020. The goal is to conduct further analysis on population flow. Furthermore, the results generated in the form of plots will be subsequently presented in dashboards (specifically 2015-2020) to gain better insights into the patterns and performance of the airline carriers. Some KPIs recorded were:

- Flight count by airline to destination state
- Percentage of flights by reporting airline
- Number of flights from origin state
- Monthly flight cancellation
- Average monthly flight time by airplane
- Average carrier delay time by airline
- Average weather delay time by airline
- Average NAS delay time by airline
- Average security delay time by airline
- Average late aircraft delay time by airline

We will mostly be using Plotly for visualising the data as well as Dash and basic Dash components (core and HTML).

## About the dataset

It contains information on approximately 200 million domestic US flights reported to the United States Bureau of Transportation Statistics. The dataset contains basic information about each flight (such as date, time, departure airport, arrival airport) and, if applicable, the amount of time the flight was delayed and information about the reason for the delay. This dataset can be used to predict the likelihood of a flight arriving on time.
