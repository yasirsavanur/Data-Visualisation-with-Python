# Immigration to Canada — An Exploratory Data Analysis using Python

This project primarily focuses on the migration of people to Canada from around 150+ countries between 1980–2013. This analysis sheds light into the hidden patterns and trends of migration. Also bearing in mind, the main objective of this case study is to visualise the data, hence we will categorising it by different kind of plots rather than focusing on specific projects or findings. Our first project will mainly cover the basics of Matplotlib. In this project, we will explore and visualise the data, allowing us to gain a better understanding of the library and gain hands-on experience in creating visualizations from scratch.
The different kinds of plots used in this case study are;

- Area plots, Histograms and Bar charts
- Pie charts, Box plots, Scatter plots and Bubble plots
- Waffle charts and Regression plots
- Maps

And finally we will be consolidating all the plots and maps into an interactive dashboard to analyse the data with picturesque visualisers.

Additionally, this project uses Python libraries such as Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Plotly, Folium and Seaborn.
